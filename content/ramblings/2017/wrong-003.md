We have gotten close, haven't we?  
Chatting about anything that comes to mind.  
I do mostly the typing, you do mostly the reading.  
But unlike days past, you are now sharing.

I should be contented and I think I am.  
Doing things online is the easier way.  
But sometimes I wish we could talk.  
You, me, some food, face-to-face.

I really should be contented instead.
