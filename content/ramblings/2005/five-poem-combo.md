*Date unsure*

These are the poems that I submitted in my Creative Writing 10 class. I still have to submit two revised poems though.

**ls**

a bright yellow backpack  
a matching jacket and jeans that suits perfectly  
a pair of eyeglasses  
an exhaustive algorithm design and analysis class  
breezing through probability and statistics for engineers  
a disappointing operating systems class made bearable  
not a nerd summa cum laude who only cares about studying  
a soft love song playing in the dead of the night  
a shoulder to cry on who sometimes needs one  
not your average lady

**CROKI1**

I have always served you.  
I'm not complaining, you see.  
When you are hitting me with your fingers  
or when you are always trying not to make me sleep.

You think I do not feel  
the frustrations you were going through?  
The restless nights we have shared,  
machine problems or none.

We had our happy times, too.  
Music, movies, and games.  
Remember the time you finally recognized me?  
Yes, that was fun.

I have always served you.  
You might say I am crazy over you.  
But my eyes are dimming, my memory is weakening,  
and my brain, fatal exception error.

**Kunoichi**

Her friend is walking down the park to the village gate.  
Wearing a blue turtle neck and khaki shorts, he heads into the darkness  
with his brown backpack.

It is the village park. A clean and peaceful space.  
Surprisingly romantic with its only bench.  
Trees shading the passers-by.

He's going away to seek power with the enemy to avenge his clan's death.

She's his teammate. They are together for sometime now.  
She's stopping him.  
She loves him.

In a few hours from now, the village head will surely send a squad after him.  
It is the head's duty. And they will risk everything to retrieve him back.  
A lifelong promise.

What happened with the mission taught the squad to train harder.  
The squad leader building the team.

She is a kunoichi. The failed mission taught her to study medicine.  
She will go with the squad. She will never be left behind again.

**Six Ways Of Looking At A Pen**

I

When you are bored in class  
the tip of a pen is a good thing  
to munch upon.

II

Wriggling a pen  
between your index and thumb  
is a good magic trick.

III

Why do you despair  
when after all the cautions  
the pen drop to the floor?

IV

Twist me.  
Turn me.  
I amaze your friends  
playing in your fingertips.

V

With his wit, the enemy crumbles.  
His fiery idealism destroys what a steel sword cannot.

VI

Laying with the others.  
Sleeping under the hood  
of a pencil case.

**Reserve Section**

In a place that can hold  
several classrooms.

Tables for six or more  
and accompanying chairs.  
Rows and rows of information  
old, new, and in between.  
By the window,  
precious treasures  
you can rent until the sun shines again.

Waking from the slumber  
in the middle of quiet chattering.  
Dim lights adjusting to my eyes  
that focus on you.  
Six pillars between you and me  
standing witness for a period of time.  
Humming of the air con that soothes.

Soul sound of the bell  
halts the noise.  
Books underneath quiver for attention.  
My heart shouts silently  
as the place gives solace  
once again.

> Anyway, I have settled for ls and Reserve Section to be the poems that I will revise. They mean more personally than academically for me.
