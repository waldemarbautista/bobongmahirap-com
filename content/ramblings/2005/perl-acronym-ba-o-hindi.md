Ayon sa http://www.philhosting.net/?menu=webhosting_faq,

What are PHP, ASP, perl, etc?  
These are all programming languages which are referred to by their acronyms.

PHP - PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor  
ASP - Active Server Pages  
**Perl - not an acronym**

Each programming language has its own benefits and uses. It is best that you research on your own to find one that best fits your needs

Ngunit hindi ba ang ibig sabihin ng Perl ay Practical Extraction and Report Language?
