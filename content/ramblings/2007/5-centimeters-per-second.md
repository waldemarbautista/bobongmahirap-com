I'm always searching, for your figure to appear somewhere

On the opposite platform, in the windows off the street

Even though I know you couldn't be at such a place

If my wish were to come true, I would go to your side right now

There would be nothing I couldn't do

I would put everything on the line and hold you tight

If I just wanted to avoid loneliness, anybody would have been enough

Because the night looks like the stars will fall, I cannot lie to myself

One more time, oh seasons, fade not

One more time, when we were messing around

I'm always searching, for your figure to appear somewhere

At a street crossing, or in the midst of dreams

Even though I know you couldn't be at such a place

If a miracle were to happen here, I would show you right away

The new morning, who I'll be from now on

And the words I never said: "I love you"

The memories of summer are revolving

The throbbing which suddenly disappeared

I'm always searching, for your figure to appear somewhere

In the town at dawn, at Sakuragi-cho

Even though I know you wouldn't come to such a place

If my wish were to come true, I would go to your side right now

There would be nothing I couldn't do

I would put everything on the line and hold you tight

I'm always searching, for fragments of you to appear somewhere

In a store during my travels, in the corner of newspaper

Even though I know you couldn't be at such a place

If a miracle were to happen here, I would show you right away

The new morning, who I'll be from now on

And the words I never said: "I love you"

I always end up looking for your smile, to appear somewhere

At the railroad crossing, waiting for the express to pass

Even though I know you couldn't be at such a place

If our lives could be repeated, I would be at your side every time

I would want nothing else

Nothing matters except for you

> Kung pagbabasehan ang kwento nung pelikula na 5 Centimeters Per Second, wala siguro dahil tungkol sa magkababata yun e wala naman akong kababatang babae na gusto ko.  
> Pero kung ang pagbabasehan ay ang kanta na may pamagat na One More Time, One More Chance ni Masayoshi Yamazaki na ginamit sa pelikula na yan, aba sa lyrics pa lang e mahahalata mo na kung para kanino. Haha.
