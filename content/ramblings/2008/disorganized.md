I've been here for a long time now. I'm neither going forward nor backward. I'm staying put without any clear reasons. I'm the only one left now. All of them have already moved on. To where the lands are green and the skies are blue and the earth is alive and new.

You don't know me. They don't know me. Nobody has the time to understand me. Everything is a joke if it concerns me. We all laugh at silly matters at the same time but really, we never laugh together. We are a company but we are never close. The memory is fast fading.

I've been behind from the very start. I'm never serious to begin with. I don't believe in this bureaucracy. And whatever you think or do to me, you will never convert me. I will fight my way through. I believe in myself. I can also work hard like others. Only you have something to lose.

This is the longest winter. I'm caught in a trap and can't seem to make my way out. I'm already cold but nobody can see me. You already left. I lost my goal. I can't move in this environment. And until the sun shines and the flowers bloom, I will still be here. Alone. And Lonely.
