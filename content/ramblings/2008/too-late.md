as the stillness of the night moves before my eyes  
i saw a figure that made me realize  
that is was you, girl, sent by Him from up above  
to come to me whispering words of tender love

she told me she misses the way i look at her  
that she longs to see my smile for another day  
and she confessed without me she would fall apart  
she said that she really loves me with all her heart

i said i also feel the same way that she does  
that i have feelings for her like for me, she has  
and i also misses the things that she told me  
all the laughters we shared, all the sweet words i heard

but after all these, i am afraid it's too late  
i admit my mistakes 'cause i still want you back  
but now you're gone to where others dare not to  
and i can do nothing but cry 'cause i love you
