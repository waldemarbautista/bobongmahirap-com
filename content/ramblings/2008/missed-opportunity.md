it's been so long since the last time i've talked to you  
i've been hurting since then but you did not know it  
i'm really trying hard to have a chance with you  
but all i'm getting are just sorrows for my heart

and because of these loneliness and emptiness  
there's a time when i think of looking for someone new  
but all my thoughts always end up calling for you  
just as my love for you will always be true

and now you're sitting right here not so far from me  
we're all alone but i cannot express myself  
damn me, i missed the greatest opportunity  
what a shame to think that i've just wasted your time

i know it's hard for you to give me another chance  
but please, i promise not to be the same again  
the words i want to say are longing to be out  
i just want to say i love you from the very start
